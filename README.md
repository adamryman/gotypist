# Gotypist

A simple touch-typing tutor that follows [Steve Yegge's methodology](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html) of going in fast, slow, and medium cycles.

This project is mainly motivated by trying out [termbox-go](https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go), but it is definitely ready for productive learning.
